# Unit 1 Exercise 1
What to implement for this exercise:

### Employee Class
Write a basic Employee class that is extended by Administration type positions (salary) and Worker type positions (Hourly). A basic Employee class may contain information like an Employee ID, date hired, and status (currently active: true or false). The goal is to write three basic classes, two of which inherit from the other.

### Event Ticket
Consider an event Ticket. A ticketâ€™s price depends on several factors; Advance vs Walkup, Adult vs Child vs Student vs Senior. Each ticket has a unique number to identify it regardless of price. Build a basic ticket object as your superclass which generates the ticket number, then write a subclass for one of the different types of tickets with corresponding methods to identify deeper parameters. How might you go about this problem with an interface? Would it be better than Inheritance?

### Shapes Interface
Write the Shapes interface we discussed in class. The interface should enforce methods to calculate and return said information. Implement this on a Square and Circle object.

### Vehicle Interface
Write the interface for a Vehicle described by its color, number of axles, VIN, and model year. Implement this for a Car object which is distinguished by its mileage and number of cupholders; and a Truck object distinguished by its horsepower and whether it is equipped with a plow package or not.
